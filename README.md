# Simple audio player using Arduino and SD card module

Hi,
It is a simple project to play an audio file in the SD card using Arduino UNO.

For this, audio file must be in .wav format and has sampling rate of 16000Hz and 8bit resolution.

For this experiment following components are needed:
1. Arduino UNO Board
2. Bread board
3. A tiny speaker
4. Micro SD card module for Arduino
5. *A low voltage audio amplifier - LM386
6. *Resistors 1kΩ and 10kΩ.
7. *Capcitors 10µF and 100µF.

*the components are required for amplify the output signal for better results, these components are optional.

The circuit diagaram is provided in the repository. The audio file will play during Arduino startup.

The other functions of library are provided below, for more check out at TMRpcm library wiki: https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm/wiki

Goodluck!
